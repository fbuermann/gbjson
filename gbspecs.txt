3. FILE FORMATS

  The flat file examples included in this section, while not always from the
current release, are usually fairly recent.  Any differences compared to the
actual records are the result of updates to the entries involved.

3.1 File Header Information

  With the exception of the lists of new, changed, and
deleted accession numbers, each of the files of a GenBank release begins
with the same header, except for the first line, which contains the file
name, and the sixth line, which contains the title of the file. The first
line of the file contains the file name in character positions 1 to 9 and
the full database name (Genetic Sequence Data Bank, aka 'GenBank') starting
in column 22. The brief names of the files in this release are listed in
Section 2.2.

  The second line contains the date of the current release in the form
`day month year', beginning in position 27. The fourth line contains
the current GenBank release number. The release number appears in
positions 48 to 52 and consists of three numbers separated by a decimal
point. The number to the left of the decimal is the major release
number. The digit to the right of the decimal indicates the version of
the major release; it is zero for the first version. The sixth line
contains a title for the file. The eighth line lists the number of
entries (loci), number of bases (or base pairs), and number of reports
of sequences (equal to number of entries in this case). These numbers are
right-justified at fixed positions. The number of entries appears in
positions 1 to 8, the number of bases in positions 16 to 26, and the
number of reports in positions 40 to 47. The third, fifth, seventh, and
ninth lines are blank.

Example 1. Sample File Header

3.4 Sequence Entry Files

  GenBank releases contain one or more sequence entry data files, one
for each "division" of GenBank.

3.4.1 File Organization

  Each of these files has the same format and consists of two parts:
header information (described in section 3.1) and sequence entries for
that division (described in the following sections).

3.4.2  Entry Organization

  In the second portion of a sequence entry file (containing the
sequence entries for that division), each record (line) consists of
two parts. The first part is found in positions 1 to 10 and may
contain:

1. A keyword, beginning in column 1 of the record (e.g., REFERENCE is
a keyword).

2. A subkeyword beginning in column 3, with columns 1 and 2 blank
(e.g., AUTHORS is a subkeyword of REFERENCE). Or a subkeyword beginning
in column 4, with columns 1, 2, and 3 blank (e.g., PUBMED is a
subkeyword of REFERENCE).

3. Blank characters, indicating that this record is a continuation of
the information under the keyword or subkeyword above it.

4. A code, beginning in column 6, indicating the nature of an entry
(feature key) in the FEATURES table; these codes are described in
Section 3.4.12.1 below.

5. A number, ending in column 9 of the record. This number occurs in
the portion of the entry describing the actual nucleotide sequence and
designates the numbering of sequence positions.

6. Two slashes (//) in positions 1 and 2, marking the end of an entry.

  The second part of each sequence entry record contains the information
appropriate to its keyword, in positions 13 to 80 for keywords and
positions 11 to 80 for the sequence.

  The following is a brief description of each entry field. Detailed
information about each field may be found in Sections 3.4.4 to 3.4.15.

LOCUS	- A short mnemonic name for the entry, chosen to suggest the
sequence's definition. Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.

DEFINITION	- A concise description of the sequence. Mandatory
keyword/one or more records.

ACCESSION	- The primary accession number is a unique, unchanging
identifier assigned to each GenBank sequence record. (Please use this
identifier when citing information from GenBank.) Mandatory keyword/one
or more records.

VERSION		- A compound identifier consisting of the primary
accession number and a numeric version number associated with the
current version of the sequence data in the record. This is optionally
followed by an integer identifier (a "GI") assigned to the sequence
by NCBI. Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.

  NOTE : Presentation of GI sequence identifiers in the GenBank
  flatfile format was discontinued as of March 2017.

NID		- An alternative method of presenting the NCBI GI
identifier (described above).

  NOTE: The NID linetype is obsolete and was removed from the
  GenBank flatfile format in December 1999.

PROJECT		- The identifier of a project (such as a Genome
Sequencing Project) to which a GenBank sequence record belongs.
Optional keyword/one or more records.

  NOTE: The PROJECT linetype is obsolete and was removed from the
  GenBank flatfile format after Release 171.0 in April 2009.

DBLINK		- Provides cross-references to resources that
support the existence a sequence record, such as the Project Database
and the NCBI Trace Assembly Archive. Optional keyword/one or
more records.

KEYWORDS	- Short phrases describing gene products and other
information about an entry. Mandatory keyword in all annotated
entries/one or more records.

SEGMENT	- Information on the order in which this entry appears in a
series of discontinuous sequences from the same molecule. Optional
keyword (only in segmented entries)/exactly one record.

  NOTE: The SEGMENT linetype is obsolete given the conversion of
  of all segmented sets to gapped CON-division records, completed
  as of GenBank Release 221.0 in August 2017. No new segmented set
  submissions will be accepted by GenBank.

SOURCE	- Common name of the organism or the name most frequently used
in the literature. Mandatory keyword in all annotated entries/one or
more records/includes one subkeyword.

   ORGANISM	- Formal scientific name of the organism (first line)
and taxonomic classification levels (second and subsequent lines).
Mandatory subkeyword in all annotated entries/two or more records.

   In the event that the organism name exceeds 68 characters (80 - 13 + 1)
   in length, it will be line-wrapped and continue on a second line,
   prior to the taxonomic classification. Unfortunately, very long 
   organism names were not anticipated when the fixed-length GenBank
   flatfile format was defined in the 1980s. The possibility of linewraps
   makes the job of flatfile parsers more difficult : essentially, one
   cannot be sure that the second line is truly a classification/lineage
   unless it consists of multiple tokens, delimited by semi-colons.
   The long-term solution to this problem is to introduce an additional
   subkeyword, probably 'LINEAGE' . This might occur sometime in 2009
   or 2010.

REFERENCE	- Citations for all articles containing data reported
in this entry. Includes seven subkeywords and may repeat. Mandatory
keyword/one or more records.

   AUTHORS	- Lists the authors of the citation. Optional
subkeyword/one or more records.

   CONSRTM	- Lists the collective names of consortiums associated
with the citation (eg, International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium),
rather than individual author names. Optional subkeyword/one or more records.

   TITLE	- Full title of citation. Optional subkeyword (present
in all but unpublished citations)/one or more records.

   JOURNAL	- Lists the journal name, volume, year, and page
numbers of the citation. Mandatory subkeyword/one or more records.

   MEDLINE	- Provides the Medline unique identifier for a
citation. Optional subkeyword/one record.

   NOTE: The MEDLINE linetype is obsolete and was removed
   from the GenBank flatfile format in April 2005.

    PUBMED 	- Provides the PubMed unique identifier for a
citation. Optional subkeyword/one record.

   REMARK	- Specifies the relevance of a citation to an
entry. Optional subkeyword/one or more records.

COMMENT	- Cross-references to other sequence entries, comparisons to
other collections, notes of changes in LOCUS names, and other remarks.
Optional keyword/one or more records/may include blank records.

FEATURES	- Table containing information on portions of the
sequence that code for proteins and RNA molecules and information on
experimentally determined sites of biological significance. Optional
keyword/one or more records.

BASE COUNT	- Summary of the number of occurrences of each basepair
code (a, c, t, g, and other) in the sequence. Optional keyword/exactly
one record. 

   NOTE: The BASE COUNT linetype is obsolete and was removed
   from the GenBank flatfile format in October 2003.

CONTIG	- This linetype provides information about how individual sequence
records can be combined to form larger-scale biological objects, such as
chromosomes or complete genomes. Rather than presenting actual sequence
data, a special join() statement on the CONTIG line provides the accession
numbers and basepair ranges of the underlying records which comprise the
object.

As of August 2005, the 2L chromosome arm of Drosophila melanogaster
(accession number AE014134) provided a good example of CONTIG use.

ORIGIN	- Specification of how the first base of the reported sequence
is operationally located within the genome. Where possible, this
includes its location within a larger genetic map. Mandatory
keyword/exactly one record.

	- The ORIGIN line is followed by sequence data (multiple records).

// 	- Entry termination symbol. Mandatory at the end of an
entry/exactly one record.

3.4.3 Sample Sequence Data File

  An example of a complete sequence entry file follows. (This example
has only two entries.) Note that in this example, as throughout the
data bank, numbers in square brackets indicate items in the REFERENCE
list. For example, in ACARR58S, [1] refers to the paper by Mackay, et
al.

Example 9. Sample Sequence Data File


3.4.4 LOCUS Format

3.4.4.1 : Important notice about parsing the LOCUS line

  Users who process the data elements of the LOCUS line should use a
token-based parsing approach rather than parsing its content based on
fixed column positions.

  Historically, the LOCUS line has had a fixed length and its elements have
been presented at specific column positions. A complete description of the
data fields and their typical column positions is provided in Section 3.4.4.2 .
But with the anticipated increases in the lengths of accession numbers, and
the advent of sequences that are gigabases long, maintaining the column
positions will not always be possible and the overall length of the LOCUS
line could exceed 79 characters.

  Consider this LOCUS line for a typical complete bacterial genome:

LOCUS       CP032762             5868661 bp    DNA     circular BCT 15-OCT-2018
------------+--------------+-+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------
1          13             28 30       40        50        60        70       79

  Now contrast this with a hypothetical gigabase-scale WGS sequence record that
utilizes the 6 + 2 + 7/8/9 accession format:

LOCUS       AZZZAA02123456789 9999999999 bp    DNA     linear   PRI 15-OCT-2018
------------+--------------+-+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------
1          13             28 30       40        50        60        70       79

  Here, Locus-Name/Accession-Number must occupy the space at position 29 which
normally separates the Locus from the Sequence Length. And if the sequence
length had been 10 Gigabases or greater, the Locus-Name and Sequence Length
would directly abut each other:

LOCUS       AZZZAA0212345678910000000000 bp    DNA     linear   PRI 15-OCT-2018
------------+--------------+-+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------
1          13             28 30       40        50        60        70       79

  In cases like this, a space would be introduced to ensure that the two fields
are separated, all other values would be shifted to the right, and the length of
the LOCUS line would increase:

LOCUS       AZZZAA02123456789 10000000000 bp    DNA     linear   PRI 15-OCT-2018
------------+--------------+-+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------
1          13             28 30       40        50        60        70       79

  Because the Locus-Name/Accession-Number is left-justified and the
Sequence-Length is right-justified, *most* GenBank records will conform to the
historical column positions that are described below. But since there will be
exceptions, we recommend that users parse the LOCUS line based on
whitespace-separated tokens.

3.4.4.2 : Data elements of the LOCUS line

  The data elements of the LOCUS line format and their typical/historical
column positions are as follows:

Positions  Contents
---------  --------
01-05      'LOCUS'
06-12      spaces
13-28      Locus Name (usually identical to the Accession Number)
29-29      space
30-40      Sequence Length, right-justified
41-41      space
42-43      'bp'
44-44      space
45-47      Strandedness : spaces (if not known), ss- (single-stranded),
           ds- (double-stranded), or ms- (mixed-stranded)
48-53      Molecule Type: NA, DNA, RNA, tRNA (transfer RNA), rRNA (ribosomal RNA), 
           mRNA (messenger RNA), uRNA (small nuclear RNA).
           Left justified.
54-55      space
56-63      Molecule Topology : 'linear' followed by two spaces,
           or 'circular'
64-64      space
65-67      Division Code
68-68      space
69-79      Update Date, in the form dd-MMM-yyyy (e.g., 15-MAR-1991)

  These column positions are typical/nominal, not guaranteed. See Section
3.4.4.1 for important suggestions about parsing the LOCUS line.

  The Locus Name element was originally designed to help group entries with
similar sequences: the first three characters designated the organism; the
fourth and fifth characters could be used to show other group designations,
such as gene product; for segmented entries (now obsolete) the last character
could be one of a series of sequential integers. Here are two examples of
older GenBank records that have Locus Names :

LOCUS       HUMPDNRC                 273 bp    DNA     linear   PRI 04-OCT-1993
DEFINITION  Human D9S125 polymorphic dinucleotide repeat.
ACCESSION   L10620

LOCUS       HUMPDNRG                 169 bp    DNA     linear   PRI 04-OCT-1993
DEFINITION  Human D9S114 polymorphic dinucleotide repeat.
ACCESSION   L10624

  But in the mid-1990s, maintaining unique Locus Names in addition to unique
Accession Numbers became unsustainable and the assignment of new Locus Names
ceased. The overwhelming majority of sequence records now have no Locus Name,
and their Accession Number is displayed on the LOCUS line instead. For example:

LOCUS       AF035771                1357 bp    mRNA    linear   PRI 30-JUN-1998
DEFINITION  Homo sapiens Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF-2) mRNA,
            complete cds.
ACCESSION   AF035771
	    
  The Division Code element of the LOCUS format is a three-letter abbreviation
whose value can be :

PRI - primate sequences
ROD - rodent sequences
MAM - other mammalian sequences
VRT - other vertebrate sequences
INV - invertebrate sequences
PLN - plant, fungal, and algal sequences
BCT - bacterial sequences
VRL - viral sequences
PHG - bacteriophage sequences
SYN - synthetic sequences
UNA - unannotated sequences
EST - EST sequences (Expressed Sequence Tags) 
PAT - patent sequences
STS - STS sequences (Sequence Tagged Sites) 
GSS - GSS sequences (Genome Survey Sequences) 
HTG - HTGS sequences (High Throughput Genomic sequences) 
HTC - HTC sequences (High Throughput cDNA sequences) 
ENV - Environmental sampling sequences
CON - Constructed sequences
TSA - Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly sequences

  The Molecule Type for all non-coding RNA sequences is 'RNA'. Further
information about the specific type of non-coding RNA can be obtained from
the full-length ncRNA feature that will be present on such sequences.

3.4.5 DEFINITION Format

  The DEFINITION record gives a brief description of the sequence,
proceeding from general to specific. It starts with the common name of
the source organism, then gives the criteria by which this sequence is
distinguished from the remainder of the source genome, such as the
gene name and what it codes for, or the protein name and mRNA, or some
description of the sequence's function (if the sequence is
non-coding). If the sequence has a coding region, the description may
be followed by a completeness qualifier, such as cds (complete coding
sequence). There is no limit on the number of lines that may be part
of the DEFINITION.  The last line must end with a period.

3.4.5.1 DEFINITION Format for NLM Entries

  The DEFINITION line for entries derived from journal-scanning at the NLM is
an automatically generated descriptive summary that accompanies each DNA and
protein sequence. It contains information derived from fields in a database 
that summarize the most important attributes of the sequence.  The DEFINITION
lines are designed to supplement the accession number and the sequence itself
as a means of uniquely and completely specifying DNA and protein sequences. The
following are examples of NLM DEFINITION lines:

NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase [swine, mRNA, 1 gene, 1585 nt]

94 kda fiber cell beaded-filament structural protein [rats, lens, mRNA
Partial, 1 gene, 1873 nt]

inhibin alpha {promoter and exons} [mice, Genomic, 1 gene, 1102 nt, segment
1 of 2]

cefEF, cefG=acetyl coenzyme A:deacetylcephalosporin C o-acetyltransferase
[Acremonium chrysogenum, Genomic, 2 genes, 2639 nt]

myogenic factor 3, qmf3=helix-loop-helix protein [Japanese quails,
embryo, Peptide Partial, 246 aa]


  The first part of the definition line contains information describing
the genes and proteins represented by the molecular sequences.  This can
be gene locus names, protein names and descriptions that replace or augment
actual names.  Gene and gene product are linked by "=".  Any special
identifying terms are presented within brackets, such as: {promoter},
{N-terminal}, {EC 2.13.2.4}, {alternatively spliced}, or {3' region}.

  The second part of the definition line is delimited by square brackets, '[]',
and provides details about the molecule type and length.  The biological
source, i.e., genus and species or common name as cited by the author.
Developmental stage, tissue type and strain are included if available.
The molecule types include: Genomic, mRNA, Peptide. and Other Genomic
Material. Genomic molecules are assumed to be partial sequence unless
"Complete" is specified, whereas mRNA and peptide molecules are assumed
to be complete unless "Partial" is noted.

3.4.6 ACCESSION Format

  This field contains a series of six-character and/or eight-character
identifiers called 'accession numbers'. The six-character accession
number format consists of a single uppercase letter, followed by 5 digits.
The eight-character accession number format consists of two uppercase
letters, followed by 6 digits. The 'primary', or first, of the accession
numbers occupies positions 13 to 18 (6-character format) or positions
13 to 20 (8-character format). Subsequent 'secondary' accession numbers
(if present) are separated from the primary, and from each other, by a
single space. In some cases, multiple lines of secondary accession
numbers might be present, starting at position 13.

  The primary accession number of a GenBank entry provides a stable identifier
for the biological object that the entry represents. Accessions do not change
when the underlying sequence data or associated features change.

  Secondary accession numbers arise for a number of reasons. For example, a
single accession number may initially be assigned to a sequence described in
a publication. If it is later discovered that the sequence must be entered
into the database as multiple entries, each entry would receive a new primary
accession number, and the original accession number would appear as a secondary
accession number on each of the new entries. In the event that a large number
of continuous secondary accession numbers exist, a range can be employed:

	SecAccession1-SecAccession2

In such cases, the alphabetic prefix letters of the initial and terminal 
accession numbers within the range *MUST* be identical. For example:

	AE000111-AE000510O
        ^^       ^^

Additionally, the value of the numeric portion of the initial secondary
within the range must be less than the value of the numeric portion of the
terminal secondary.

3.4.7.1 VERSION Format

  This line contains a compound identifier consisting of the accession
number plus the sequential version number of the associated sequence.

LOCUS       AF181452     1294 bp    DNA             PLN       12-OCT-1999
DEFINITION  Hordeum vulgare dehydrin (Dhn2) gene, complete cds.
ACCESSION   AF181452
VERSION     AF181452.1
            ^^^^^^^^^^
            Compound  
            Accession.Version
            Number

  A compound Accession.Version consists of two parts: a stable, unchanging
primary-accession number portion (see Section 3.4.6 for a description of
accession numbers), and a sequentially increasing numeric version number.
The accession and version numbers are separated by a period. The initial
version number assigned to a new sequence is one.

  An accession number allows one to retrieve the same biological object in the
database, regardless of any changes that are made to the entry over time. But
those changes can include changes to the sequence data itself, which is of
fundamental importance to many database users. So a numeric version number is
associated with the sequence data in every database entry. If an entry (for
example, AF181452) undergoes two sequence changes, its compound accession
number on the VERSION line would start as AF181452.1 . After the first sequence
change this would become: AF181452.2 . And after the second change: AF181452.3 .

  Numeric NCBI "GI" sequence identifiers also used to be included on the
VERSION line, but that practice was discontinued in March of 2017.

  GenBank Releases contain only the most recent versions of all sequences
in the database. However, older versions can be obtained via
Accession.Version-based queries with NCBI's web-Entrez and network-Entrez
applications. A sequence 'revision history' resource is also available,
within Entrez:Nucleotide. For example:

   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AF123456.1?report=girevhist

NOTE: All the version numbers for the compound Accession.Version identifier
system were initialized to a value of one (".1") in February 1999, when the
system was first introduced.

3.4.7.2 DBLINK Format

  This line contains cross-references to other underlying resources that
support the existence of a GenBank sequence record. For example:

LOCUS       ANHA01000001             503 bp    DNA     linear   BCT 23-NOV-2012
DEFINITION  Campylobacter coli BIGS0016 3011, whole genome shotgun sequence.
ACCESSION   ANHA01000001 ANHA01000000
VERSION     ANHA01000001.1
DBLINK      BioProject: PRJNA177352
            BioSample: SAMN01795900

  A DBLINK cross-reference consists of two data fields delimited by a colon.
The first field provides the cross-reference type ("BioProject"), while the
second contains the actual cross-reference identifier ("PRJNA177352").

  The second field can consist of multiple comma-separated identifiers,
if a sequence record has multiple DBLINK cross-references of a given type.
For example:

DBLINK      BioProject:PRJNA174162,PRJNA999998,PRJNA999999

  And, as in this example, there can be multiple distinct types of DBLINK
cross-references. Each new type will start on a new line, with the first
colon-delimited token being the name of the cross-referenced resource.

  As of April 2013, the supported DBLINK cross-reference types are "Project"
(predecessor of BioProject), "BioProject", "BioSample", "Trace Assembly Archive",
"Sequence Read Archive", and "Assembly".

  DBLINK cross-references of type 'BioProject' are BioProject Accession
Number identifiers within the Entrez:BioProject resource at the NCBI:

	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject

  At the above URL, a search for PRJNA177352 would provide information about the
Campylobacter coli sequencing project (underway or completed), the center(s)
performing the sequencing and annotation, information about the organism, etc.
For a more detailed overview of NCBI's BioProject resource:

	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK54016/

  DBLINK cross-references of type 'Assembly' are AssemblyID identifiers within
the Assembly resource at NCBI:

	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly

  At the above URL, a search for GCA_000321225.1 would provide assembly details
and statistics for the Odobenus rosmarus divergens (Pacific walrus) genome assembly
submitted by the center(s) that performed the assembly. For a more detailed overview
of NCBI's Assembly resource:

   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/help/

3.4.8 KEYWORDS Format

  The KEYWORDS field does not appear in unannotated entries, but is
required in all annotated entries. Keywords are separated by
semicolons; a "keyword" may be a single word or a phrase consisting of
several words. Each line in the keywords field ends in a semicolon;
the last line ends with a period. If no keywords are included in the
entry, the KEYWORDS record contains only a period.

3.4.9 SEGMENT Format

  NOTE: The SEGMENT linetype is obsolete given the conversion of
  of all segmented sets to gapped CON-division records, completed
  as of GenBank Release 221.0 in August 2017. No new segmented set
  submissions will be accepted by GenBank.

  The SEGMENT keyword is used when two (or more) entries of known
relative orientation are separated by a short (<10 kb) stretch of DNA.
It is limited to one line of the form `n of m', where `n' is the
segment number of the current entry and `m' is the total number of
segments.

3.4.10 SOURCE Format

  The SOURCE field consists of two parts. The first part is found after
the SOURCE keyword and contains free-format information including an
abbreviated form of the organism name followed by a molecule type;
multiple lines are allowed, but the last line must end with a period.
The second part consists of information found after the ORGANISM
subkeyword. The formal scientific name for the source organism (genus
and species, where appropriate) is found on the same line as ORGANISM.
The records following the ORGANISM line list the taxonomic
classification levels, separated by semicolons and ending with a
period.

3.4.11 REFERENCE Format

  The REFERENCE field consists of five parts: the keyword REFERENCE, and
the subkeywords AUTHORS, TITLE (optional), JOURNAL, MEDLINE (optional),
PUBMED (optional), and REMARK (optional).

  The REFERENCE line contains the number of the particular reference and
(in parentheses) the range of bases in the sequence entry reported in
this citation. Additional prose notes may also be found within the
parentheses. The numbering of the references does not reflect
publication dates or priorities.

  The AUTHORS line lists the authors in the order in which they appear
in the cited article. Last names are separated from initials by a
comma (no space); there is no comma before the final `and'. The list
of authors ends with a period.  The TITLE line is an optional field,
although it appears in the majority of entries. It does not appear in
unpublished sequence data entries that have been deposited directly
into the GenBank data bank, the European Nucleotide Archive,
or the DNA Data Bank of Japan. The TITLE field does not end with a
period.

  The JOURNAL line gives the appropriate literature citation for the
sequence in the entry. The word `Unpublished' will appear after the
JOURNAL subkeyword if the data did not appear in the scientific
literature, but was directly deposited into the data bank. For
published sequences the JOURNAL line gives the Thesis, Journal, or
Book citation, including the year of publication, the specific
citation, or In press.

  For Book citations, the JOURNAL line is specially-formatted, and
includes:

	editor name(s)
	book title
	page number(s)
	publisher-name/publisher-location
	year

For example:

LOCUS       AY277550                1440 bp    DNA     linear   BCT 17-JUN-2003
DEFINITION  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain CSC13-6 16S ribosomal RNA gene,
            partial sequence.
ACCESSION   AY277550
....
REFERENCE   1  (bases 1 to 1440)
  AUTHORS   Gonzalez,J.M., Laiz,L. and Saiz-Jimenez,C.
  TITLE     Classifying bacterial isolates from hypogean environments:
            Application of a novel fluorimetric method dor the estimation of
            G+C mol% content in microorganisms by thermal denaturation
            temperature
  JOURNAL   (in) Saiz-Jimenez,C. (Ed.);
            MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND CULTURAL HERITAGE: 47-54;
            A.A. Balkema, The Netherlands (2003)

  The presence of "(in)" signals the fact that the reference is for a book
rather than a journal article. A semi-colon signals the end of the editor
names. The next semi-colon signals the end of the page numbers, and the
colon that immediately *precedes* the page numbers signals the end of the
book title. The publisher name and location are a free-form text string.
Finally, the year appears at the very end of the JOURNAL line, enclosed in
parentheses.

  The MEDLINE line provides the National Library of Medicine's Medline
unique identifier for a citation (if known). Medline UIs are 8 digit
numbers.

  The PUBMED line provides the PubMed unique identifier for a citation
(if known). PUBMED ids are numeric, and are record identifiers for article
abstracts in the PubMed database :

       http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed

  Citations in PubMed that do not fall within Medline's scope will have only
a PUBMED identifier. Similarly, citations that *are* in Medline's scope but
which have not yet been assigned Medline UIs will have only a PUBMED identifier.
If a citation is present in both the PubMed and Medline databases, both a
MEDLINE and a PUBMED line will be present.

  The REMARK line is a textual comment that specifies the relevance
of the citation to the entry.

3.4.12 FEATURES Format

  GenBank releases use a feature table format designed jointly by GenBank,
the European Nucleotide Archive, and the DNA Data Bank of Japan. This format
is in use by all three databases. The most complete and accurate Feature
Table documentation can be found on the Web at:

	http://www.insdc.org/documents/feature-table

  The feature table contains information about genes and gene products,
as well as regions of biological significance reported in the
sequence. The feature table contains information on regions of the
sequence that code for proteins and RNA molecules. It also enumerates
differences between different reports of the same sequence, and
provides cross-references to other data collections, as described in
more detail below.

  The first line of the feature table is a header that includes the
keyword `FEATURES' and the column header `Location/Qualifiers.' Each
feature consists of a descriptor line containing a feature key and a
location (see sections below for details). If the location does not
fit on this line, a continuation line may follow. If further
information about the feature is required, one or more lines
containing feature qualifiers may follow the descriptor line.

  The feature key begins in column 6 and may be no more than 15
characters in length. The location begins in column 22. Feature
qualifiers begin on subsequent lines at column 22. Location,
qualifier, and continuation lines may extend from column 22 to 80.

  Feature tables are required, due to the mandatory presence of the
source feature. The sections below provide a brief introduction to
the feature table format.

3.4.12.1 Feature Key Names

  The first column of the feature descriptor line contains the feature
key. It starts at column 6 and can continue to column 20. The list of
valid feature keys is available at:

	http://www.insdc.org/documents/feature-table#7.2

3.4.12.2 Feature Location

  The second column of the feature descriptor line designates the
location of the feature in the sequence. The location descriptor
begins at position 22. Several conventions are used to indicate
sequence location.

  Base numbers in location descriptors refer to numbering in the entry,
which is not necessarily the same as the numbering scheme used in the
published report. The first base in the presented sequence is numbered
base 1. Sequences are presented in the 5' to 3' direction.

Location descriptors can be one of the following:

1. A single base;

2. A contiguous span of bases;

3. A site between two bases;

4. A single base chosen from a range of bases;

5. A single base chosen from among two or more specified bases;

6. A joining of sequence spans;

7. A reference to an entry other than the one to which the feature
belongs (i.e., a remote entry), followed by a location descriptor
referring to the remote sequence;

  A site between two residues, such as an endonuclease cleavage site, is
indicated by listing the two bases separated by a carat (e.g., 23^24).

  A single residue chosen from a range of residues is indicated by the
number of the first and last bases in the range separated by a single
period (e.g., 23.79). The symbols < and > indicate that the end point
of the range is beyond the specified base number.

  A contiguous span of bases is indicated by the number of the first and
last bases in the range separated by two periods (e.g., 23..79). The
symbols < and > indicate that the end point of the range is beyond the
specified base number. Starting and ending positions can be indicated
by base number or by one of the operators described below.

  Operators are prefixes that specify what must be done to the indicated
sequence to locate the feature. The following are the operators
available, along with their most common format and a description.

complement (location): The feature is complementary to the location
indicated. Complementary strands are read 5' to 3'.

join (location, location, .. location): The indicated elements should
be placed end to end to form one contiguous sequence.

order (location, location, .. location): The elements are found in the
specified order in the 5 to 3 direction, but nothing is implied about
the rationality of joining them.

3.4.12.3  Feature Qualifiers

  Qualifiers provide additional information about features. They take
the form of a slash (/) followed by a qualifier name and, if
applicable, an equal sign (=) and a qualifier value. Feature
qualifiers begin at column 22.

  The list of valid feature keys is available at:

	http://www.insdc.org/documents/feature-table#7.3

Qualifiers convey many types of information. Their values can,
therefore, take several forms:

1. Free text;
2. Controlled vocabulary or enumerated values;
3. Citations or reference numbers;
4. Sequences;
5. Feature labels.

  Text qualifier values must be enclosed in double quotation marks. The
text can consist of any printable characters (ASCII values 32-126
decimal). If the text string includes double quotation marks, each set
must be `escaped' by placing a double quotation mark in front of it
(e.g., /note="This is an example of ""escaped"" quotation marks").

  Some qualifiers require values selected from a limited set of choices.
For example, the `/direction' qualifier has only three values `left,'
`right,' or `both.' These are called controlled vocabulary qualifier
values. Controlled qualifier values are not case sensitive; they can
be entered in any combination of upper- and lowercase without changing
their meaning.

  Citation or published reference numbers for the entry should be
enclosed in square brackets ([]) to distinguish them from other
numbers.

  A literal sequence of bases (e.g., "atgcatt") should be enclosed in
quotation marks. Literal sequences are distinguished from free text by
context. Qualifiers that take free text as their values do not take
literal sequences, and vice versa.

  The `/label=' qualifier takes a feature label as its qualifier.
Although feature labels are optional, they allow unambiguous
references to the feature. The feature label identifies a feature
within an entry; when combined with the accession number and the name
of the data bank from which it came, it is a unique tag for that
feature. Feature labels must be unique within an entry, but can be the
same as a feature label in another entry. Feature labels are not case
sensitive; they can be entered in any combination of upper-and
lowercase without changing their meaning.

3.4.12.4 Cross-Reference Information

  One type of information in the feature table lists cross-references to
the annual compilation of transfer RNA sequences in Nucleic Acids
Research, which has kindly been sent to us on CD-ROM by Dr. Sprinzl.
Each tRNA entry of the feature table contains a /note= qualifier that
includes a reference such as `(NAR: 1234)' to identify code 1234 in
the NAR compilation. When such a cross-reference appears in an entry
that contains a gene coding for a transfer RNA molecule, it refers to
the code in the tRNA gene compilation. Similar cross-references in
entries containing mature transfer RNA sequences refer to the
companion compilation of tRNA sequences published by D.H. Gauss and M.
Sprinzl in Nucleic Acids Research.

3.4.12.5 Feature Table Examples

  In the first example a number of key names, feature locations, and
qualifiers are illustrated, taken from different sequences. The first
table entry is a coding region consisting of a simple span of bases
and including a /gene qualifier. In the second table entry, an NAR
cross-reference is given (see the previous section for a discussion of
these cross-references). The third and fourth table entries use the
symbols `<`and `>' to indicate that the beginning or end of the
feature is beyond the range of the presented sequence. In the fifth
table entry, the symbol `^' indicates that the feature is between
bases.

Example 11. Scaffold/CON-division join() sequence


3.4.13 ORIGIN Format

  The ORIGIN record may be left blank, may appear as `Unreported.' or
may give a local pointer to the sequence start, usually involving an
experimentally determined restriction cleavage site or the genetic
locus (if available). The ORIGIN record ends in a period if it
contains data, but does not include the period if the record is left
empty (in contrast to the KEYWORDS field which contains a period
rather than being left blank).

3.4.14 SEQUENCE Format

  The nucleotide sequence for an entry is found in the records following
the ORIGIN record. The sequence is reported in the 5' to 3' direction.
There are sixty bases per record, listed in groups of ten bases
followed by a blank, starting at position 11 of each record. The
number of the first nucleotide in the record is given in columns 4 to
9 (right justified) of the record.

3.4.15 CONTIG Format

  As an alternative to SEQUENCE, a CONTIG record can be present
following the ORIGIN record. A join() statement utilizing a syntax
similar to that of feature locations (see the Feature Table specification
mentioned in Section 3.4.12) provides the accession numbers and basepair
ranges of other GenBank sequences which contribute to a large-scale
biological object, such as a chromosome or complete genome. Here is
an example of the use of CONTIG :

CONTIG      join(AE003590.3:1..305900,AE003589.4:61..306076,
            AE003588.3:61..308447,AE003587.4:61..314549,AE003586.3:61..306696,
            AE003585.5:61..343161,AE003584.5:61..346734,AE003583.3:101..303641,

            [ lines removed for brevity ]

            AE003782.4:61..298116,AE003783.3:16..111706,AE002603.3:61..143856)

However, the CONTIG join() statement can also utilize a special operator
which is *not* part of the syntax for feature locations:

	gap()     : Gap of unknown length.

	gap(X)    : Gap with an estimated integer length of X bases.

	            To be represented as a run of n's of length X
	            in the sequence that can be constructed from
	            the CONTIG line join() statement .

	gap(unkX) : Gap of unknown length, which is to be represented
	            as an integer number (X) of n's in the sequence that
	            can be constructed from the CONTIG line join()
	            statement.

	            The value of this gap operator consists of the 
	            literal characters 'unk', followed by an integer.

Here is an example of a CONTIG line join() that utilizes the gap() operator:

CONTIG      join(complement(AADE01002756.1:1..10234),gap(1206),
            AADE01006160.1:1..1963,gap(323),AADE01002525.1:1..11915,gap(1633),
            AADE01005641.1:1..2377)

The first and last elements of the join() statement may be a gap() operator.
But if so, then those gaps should represent telomeres, centromeres, etc.

Consecutive gap() operators are illegal.


4. ALTERNATE RELEASES

  NCBI is supplying sequence data in the GenBank flat file format to
maintain compatibility with existing software which require that
particular format.  Although we have made every effort to ensure
that these data are presented in the traditional flat file format,
if you encounter any problems in using these data with software which
is based upon the flat file format, please contact us at:

              info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

  The flat file is just one of many possible report formats that can be
generated from the richer representation supported by the ASN.1 form of the
data.  Developers of new software tools should consider using the ASN.1 form
directly to take advantage of those features.  Documentation and a Software
Developer's Toolkit for ASN.1 are available through NCBI.

  The Software Developer's Toolkit and PostScript documentation for Linux,
MacOS and Microsoft Windows systems is available in a compressed UNIX tar
file by anonymous ftp from 'ftp.ncbi.nih.gov', in the toolbox/ncbi_tools++
directory. The file is 'ncbi_cxx--18_0_0.tar.gz'.


5. KNOWN PROBLEMS OF THE GENBANK DATABASE

5.1 Incorrect Gene Symbols in Entries and Index

  The /gene qualifier for many GenBank entries contains values other than the
official gene symbol, such as the product or the standard name of the gene.

6.2 Citing GenBank

  If you have used GenBank in your research, we would appreciate it if
you would include a reference to GenBank in all publications related
to that research.

  When citing data in GenBank, it is appropriate to give the sequence
name, primary accession number, and the publication in which the
sequence first appeared.  If the data are unpublished, we urge you to
contact the group which submitted the data to GenBank to see if there
is a recent publication or if they have determined any revisions or
extensions of the data.

  It is also appropriate to list a reference for GenBank itself.  The
following publication, which describes the GenBank database, should
be cited:

   Benson DA, Cavanaugh M, Clark K, Karsch-Mizrachi I, Lipman DJ,
   Ostell J, Sayers EW
   GenBank. Nucleic Acids Res. 45(D1):D37-D42 (2017)

   DOI:   10.1093/nar/gkw1070
   PMID:  27899564
   PMCID: PMC5210553

  The following statement is an example of how one might cite GenBank
data.  It cites the sequence, its primary accession number, the group
who determined the sequence, and GenBank.  The numbers in parentheses
refer to the GenBank citation above and to the REFERENCE in the
GenBank sequence entry.

`We scanned the GenBank (1) database for sequence similarities and
found one sequence (2), GenBank accession number V00002, which showed
significant similarity...'

  (2) Nellen, W. and Gallwitz, D. J. Mol. Biol. 159, 1-18 (1982)

6.3 GenBank Distribution Formats and Media

  Complete flat file releases of the GenBank database are available via
NCBI's anonymous ftp server:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov

  Each release is cumulative, incorporating all previous GenBank data.
No retrieval software is provided. GenBank distribution via CD-ROM
ceased as of GenBank Release 106.0 (April, 1998).

6.4 Other Methods of Accessing GenBank Data

  Entrez is a molecular biology database system that presents an integrated
view of DNA and protein sequence data, 3D structure data, complete genomes,
and associated MEDLINE entries. The system is produced by the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and is available only via
the Internet (using the Web-Entrez and Network-Entrez applications).

  Accessing Entrez is easy: Simply direct your web browser of choice to:

	 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

  The Web version of Entrez has all the capabilities of the network version,
but with the visual style of the World Wide Web. If you prefer the "look and
feel" of Network-Entrez, you may download Network-Entrez from the NCBI's
FTP server:

	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/

Versions are available for PC/Windows, Macintosh and several Unix variants.

  For information about Network-Entrez, Web-Entrez or any other NCBI
services, you may contact NCBI by e-mail at info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov .

6.5 Request for Corrections and Comments

  We welcome your suggestions for improvements to GenBank. We are
especially interested to learn of errors or inconsistencies in the
data.  BankIt or Sequin can be used to submit revisions to previous
submissions.  In addition, suggestions and corrections can be sent by
electronic mail to:  update@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.  Please be certain to
indicate the GenBank release number (e.g., Release 218.0) and the
primary accession number of the entry to which your comments apply; it
is helpful if you also give the entry name and the current contents of
any data field for which you are recommending a change.
